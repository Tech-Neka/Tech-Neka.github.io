<h1> OVERVIEW </h1> </div>
  <br>
  We have all been part of an audience at one time or another, be it at a lecture auditorium, a movie hall or even a church sermon, where we must be seated on a flat ground most likely behind someone else. We all know the frustration of not being able to see the front where all the activity is going on. 
     
 <br> <br>
  
   This app was designed in response to consumers requests and necessity to choose or select their sitting positions while booking for a desired event.
  It takes into consideration the heights of the participants or the height of the seats given. Seats are allocated on a first-come-first-served basis, therefore viewers can only choose from available seats and must choose wisely based on given inputs. 
    
  <br> <br>
  
   Plese click the "Next" button below and play the game of numbers to find which seats will be most suitable for viewing the concert stage!! 
  <br><br> 
  In this game, the choice is yours!!
