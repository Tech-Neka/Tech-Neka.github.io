<h2> RESEARCH PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2> </Div>

<h2 id="h2a">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<Div id="rb20">
  For the last 30 years, various social scientists have been <i> 'gallupping' </i> the entire globe in search of the true meaning, the value, the propellants and the deterrents of happiness. 
  Their findings have been published by various media outlets or organisations at various times, the first and most consistent of them being The Sustainable Develop Solutions Network which publishes it yearly in a most comprehensive report called The World Happiness Report.
   <br><br>
   This report is largely based on survey data from the Gallup World Poll which interviews about 150 countries yearly on their views about happiness. It uses a cantril ladder on a scale of 1 to 10 to evaluate happiness based on individuals thoughts and views of their  happiness feelings each day. 
   <br><br>
  
 
  
  Among their findings, the researchers singled out six main factors that have been shown to influence happiness.    
  They include GDP per capita, ideal social networks groups, political freedom, generosity and good governance. 

  However, as can be noticed in this research from the time-series data obtained, actual measures used to estimate happiness rankings differ from country to country and year to year.  
    <h3> PURPOSE </h3> 

The purpose of this project is to investigate the latent or hidden factors influencing happiness by 
 using Statistical tools like Regression and forecasting. 
 

<br><br>
The Research questions will be formed by identifying and selecting relevant questions from those asked by inquisitive citizens or private researchers, with the aim of creating a happier society for all.

  <H2>TESTS OF SIGNIFICANCE </H2></Div>
  <br>
There are three hypotheses this project shall consider, all one-tailed, at 95% confidence levels and based on the research questions.

<H3>HYPOTHESES </H3>
<ol><li>
Weather
<br>
Ho: Weather does not influence moods <br>
H1: Colder climates impact greater levels of happiness in citizens </li>
<br>
  <li>
Location <br>
Ho: Latitude does not influence happiness <br>
H1: The further a country is from the equator, the happier it's people tend to be </li>
<br>

<li>
  Coastal Geography <br>
  Ho: The presence of large water bodies has no impact on people's feelings <br>
  H1: Citizens of countries with large coastal lines or high percentages of surrounding water are happier than others.
</li></ol>

  <H3>DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE </H3>
  Alpha is 0.05

  <H3> DECISION CRITERIA </H3>
    For all computations, reject the
    null hypothesis where the calculated probability is less than the critical value.
