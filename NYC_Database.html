<h2>DATA COLLECTION </h2>

<Div id="rb3">
  
The data collected is secondary data. It was sourced from Kaggle Online, but is also available on the New York City Data Archives.
It consists of various tables which include data on School Demographics like School Name and Enrollment ; School Attendance by percentage, Class Size, Program type and Graduation Outcomes. The data includes Nominal, Ordinal and Boolean data classes.



<h4> DATA CLEANING </h4>
The data was cleaned using Microsoft Excel wonderful Data editing tools.
First by removing duplicate records and deleting empty rows. Furthermore, font typeswere regularised using LOWER/UPPER  
<br>
This method revealed other errors like inconsistencies in naming conventions and typographical errors.
Unnecessary data were further deleted and outliers were  filtered off.

Missing values were replaced based on existing data averages.

<h4> BUILDING THE SQL DATABASE </h4>

Next, the SQL Database was built using existing the cleaned data now good enough to supply meaningful and reliable analysis with greater confidence levels. This was done by creating useful tables, views, indexes and other useful tools using SQL queries based on the Key Performance Indicators to resolve the Research request. 
The SQL software used for the project is the Microsoft SQL Server.
