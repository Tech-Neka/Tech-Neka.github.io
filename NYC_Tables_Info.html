<h2>NYC STUDENTS SAT PERFORMANCE: SQL SCHEME </h2> </Div>
<br>
<b style="font-size: 25pt;"> PURPOSE </b> 
<Div id="a4">
<p style="font-size: 25pt;">
The main purpose of the Tables SQL Scheme or Layout is to specify the appropriate data types to use for the data research and to specify integer ranges, in view of setting constraints to prevent mistakes and outliers. 

But it is also a means for identifying, and a source of obtaining useful and invaluable information about the Research focus and its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

It is also used to identify and specify useful 'slangs' or key working terms that are used uniquely within the company, industry or Research focus.. </p>
