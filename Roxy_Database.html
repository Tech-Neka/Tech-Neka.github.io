<h2>DATA COLLECTION </h2>

<Div id="rb3">
  
The data collected is second-party data. It was compiled by the Roxy BDC staff and given to the analyst.
It basically consists of Nominal, Ordinal and Boolean data classes and comprises of both numerical and non-numerical data; including numerical, text, decimal, date, float and variable-character datatypes. 



<h4> CLEANING THE DATA </h4>
The data was cleaned using Google sheets and Microsoft Excel.
First by removing duplicate records  using the UNIQUE formula <br><br>
<b><i>
=UNIQUE (range, [by_column],[exactly_once])" </i></b><br>
<br>
This method revealed other errors like inconsistencies in naming conventions and typographical errors.
Unnecessary data were further deleted and outliers were  filtered off.

Missing values were replaced based on existing data averages.

<h4> BUILDING THE SQL DATABASE </h4>

Next, the SQL Database was built using existing given data, now cleaned and pure enough to supply meaningful and reliable analysis with greater confidence levels. This was done by creating useful tables, views, indexes and other useful tools using SQL queries based on the Key Performance Indicators to resolve the business request. 
The SQL software used for the project is the Microsoft SQL Server.
