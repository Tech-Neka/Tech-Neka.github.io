<h2> SUMMARY AND RESULTS
 </h2> </Div>
<h2> <u>TIME SERIES SKEWS $ TRENDS</u></h2>
<Div id="rb3">
  
 TIME SERIES Analysis show a distinct skew or peak in the summer holiday season  This is to be expected as lots of people  travel to Europe during this time.

Less expcted/popular trends however show peaks in winter, this is mostly  by businessmen likely travelling to take advantage of the Christmas shopping discounts and holiday bonuses!

We also notice a rise in customer numbers sending money to others abroad, most probably to students for tickets back home away from the winter's cold; or for grand occasions, like weddings, that usually take place at this season. 
  

<h4><u> BUSINESS PROMOTION </u></h4>
As far as marketing is concerned lots of customers got to know about the BDC from staff, and so emphasis is suggested on exchanging staff between departments where skills or hobbies  guarantee best results. 

Furthermore, promotions and staff incentives were encouraged and elevation of best staff  to the vacant  managerial position since she qualified. 	
Finally printing and distribution of more fliers to specific places and participation in more TV and radio programs was decided to increase customer base. 	


<h4><u> CUSTOMER GROWTH</u></h4>

Though the buiness seems to have some noticeable loyal customers, it is highly encouraged to start a reward sytem to give branded gifts to these customer at festive seasons, or on grand occasions like their birthdays. 
This will further inspire their loyalty and will attract even more customers. Printing and distribution of more fliers to specific event venues like conferences and study fairs with participation in more TV and radio programs was decided as the most effective tools for winning new customers.


 <h4><u> FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE</u></h4>
 
On average Roxy is making a decent profit and has good potential for making even more in the future should all suggetions and recommendations be heeded to perfectly.
Between the two trading years, 2018 and 2019, Roxy bought and sold about five million dollars worth of local currency. Of this, 3 million was purchased from the Central bank and approximately 2 million from other vendors. <br><br>
  Profits are about 20% of sales, with more in the second year which had more weeks of trading. Also the highest volume of sales were to Businessmen especially private SME FOREX vendors followed by private travellers. Foreigners, mostly from China and the UK, make up 20% of Customer base and the most loyal customers often come to the bureau as often as ten times in per year. <br><br>
   The linked images of the Power Business Intelligence Dashboard Visualization give a clearer view of Roxy's performance, as do the Dashboards themselves, in the published work.
