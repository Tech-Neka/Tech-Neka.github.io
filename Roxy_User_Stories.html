<h1> USER STORIES AND STATISTICS

<h1>  <u>USER STORIES</u></h1>
<Div id="rb3">

User stories are tools used by agile software developers to get details about the specific features customers desire for the products they request.

These details can be 
based on product design, functionality or benefit.

 Aside product specification, user stories also consist the sequence of steps product owners and their teams expect to take in the product development process.
 
 They are best represented in tables. <br><br>


Data Analytics presents a slightly different variation of a User Story, being that the customer request is not a physical product but an offering, mostly one that amounts to a business performance review. 
 It features the customer's business request or questions, and the answers obtained by the analyst throughout the research. It also presents the optimization strategy proffered by the analyst and the performance summaries expressed as charts and dashboards for attractive visualization.

<div id="a3"> <h1><u> STATISTICS</u> </u></h1> </div>
<br><br>

Statistics are figures calculated from analyses of datasets. These figures summarise the whole of the dataset they represent or a characteristic of it and 
 can be in group form or in singular form
<br><br>
Statistics are categorised into two main groups: descriptive and inferential statistics. Descriptive Statistics 
  describe the central tendaency, the dispersion or the skewness of a dataset eg the mean or the mode; while Inferential Statistics  makes inferences about population from small datasets and predict future possible outcomes. An example is the T-test.


<br>
<h3><u> DATA ANALYTICS </u> </u></h3>
Analytics is the sytematic analysis of data or statistics for the discovery, interpetation and communication of useful insights and meaningful pattern.
They are grouped into four main categories being: descriptive, diagnostic, prescriptive and predictive.
Each user story fits under one of such groupings and it is necessary to know which one it is. 
The table below places each user story in its appropriate group and also describe their SQL queries using thumbnail images which popup into full-size images upon clicking.
