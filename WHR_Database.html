<h2> BUILDING THE DATABASE </h2> 
</Div>


<Div id="rb2">
<h4>SAMPLING AND DATA COLLECTION </h4>  
The data collected for this project is secondary data and was obtained from reliable sources including government websites and Kaggle.com. It was extracted using Excel's <span style="font-size: 22pt; color: blue"><b><i> 'GET and TRANSFORM' </i></b></span>
data tools.                                                                
It consists of mostly numerical data which are often ranked variables for easy computations, but also features nominal, ordinal and boolean data classes comprising decimal, date, and variable-character datatypes. 

<br><br>


<Div id="rb2">
  <h4> CLEANING THE DATA </h4>
  The data was cleaned using Microsoft Excel's wonderful Data editing tools and features including: <span style="font-size: 22pt; color: blue"><b><i> 'FILTER', 'FIND $ REPLACE', 'DELETE' </i></b></span> and <span style="font-size: 22pt; color: blue"><b><i> 'SORT' </i></b></span> to remove bogus and ambiguous data, erase duplicate records, delete or correct other inconsistencies such as naming conventions or typographical errors; and lastly to filter off records with missing values. 



<br><br>
<h4> SAMPLING </h4>

<Div id="rb3">
  Sampling is the process of using statistical estimates computated from small subsets of a given population to make inferences about that population. 
  These selected subsets ought to properly represent the population as much as possible and not be biased.
  <br><br>
  Sampling is classified into random and non-random sampling types. Random sampling is sub-divided into Simple, Systematic, Stratified and Cluster sampling while non-random sampling includes convenience, volunteer, judgement, snowball/networking, and quota types. 
  <br><br>
  
  This project uses Judgement sampling based on a criteria that permits only countries that participated in all the Happiness Index surveys carried out by the Gallup Poll team within the specified timeframe from 2013 to 2019. It therefore consists a large sample size of about 90% of the entire population which means a very high degree of certainty for the survey results.


<br><br>
<h4> BUILDING THE SQL DATABASE </h4>
<Div id="rb3">

Next, the SQL database was built using the cleaned data. This was done by creating useful tables, views and indexes using SQL queries which were based on the key performance indicators (KPI's)to meet the research objectives. 
<br><br>
 The SQL software used for the project is the Microsoft SQL Server.
The queries used to build the database include both simple and complex queries and utilise a wide variety of SQL tools and clauses such as  
 <span style="font-size: 22pt; color: blue"><b><i> 'SELECT', 'FROM', 'WITH', 'UNION', 'TOP', 'AVG', 'GROUP BY' </i></b></span> and <span style="font-size: 22pt; color: blue"><b><i> 'ORDER BY' </i></b></span> among others.
