<h2> SUMMARY AND RESULTS
 </h2> </Div>
<h2> <u></u></h2>
<Div id="rb3">
  
 A sample of 137 eligible countries out of about 150, were selected for this research based on the set 'Judgement Sampling' criteria that they each had participated in all the World Happiness Gallup Poll surveys from 2013 to 2019. 
  The results are presented below.
 
  

<h4><u> REGRESSION AND CORRELATION </u></h4>
  <ul><li> A linear Regression was done on the sample using the formula Y = BX + C, for all three main independent influencing factors being: Latitude, Average Temperature and Coastality. </li>
  <br>
  
  <li>The results show an average correlation of 0.50, 0.42 and 0.28 respectively at the individual country level.
</li><br>

 <li> This means that at least 25%, 18%  and 8% of the variation between happiness levels from country to country is explained by 
  a country's Latitude, Average Temperature and Coastality respectively.
</li><br>

  <li>The smallness of the values are as a result of the largeness of the sample size as there is a greater variation of features from country to country in large samples.
 </li> <br>

  <li> On the regional level however, the impact is much clearer, with Central Asia recording regression values of 0.42, 0.78 and East Asia having 0.93; and -0.7, 0.75 and 0.93 respectively. 
 </li>

  <li>For the former, These figures say that at least 18%, 61% and 87% of the difference in Happiness scores within countries in central Asia is explained by the aforementioned factors of Latitude, Temperature and Coastality respectively.   
 </li>
  <br>
  
  All in all, these results are fair enough being that the main influencers of happiness have already been established by the Gallup Poll to include factors such as good governance and GDP per capita. </ul>

  <h4><u> LATITUDES </u></h4>
    
   <ul><li> Latitudes are a unique factor as they include numbers below zero, and thus the inference is slightly unique. 
 </li><br>

  <li> Numbers are very different from values. This is because latitudes actually describe distance from the equator aand the inference is based on that. The sign is not what's inportant here. 
  </li><br>
  <li> Thus the inference reveals that countries that are further away from the equator tend to be happier than those closer;
and though these countries tend to be colder, equatorial distance is not the only factor that determines climate. The presence of mountainous regions and the presence of surrounding water are other factors that could bring about coolness to regions.
 </li></ul>   
    
    
  <h4><u> HYPOTHESES DECISION</u></h4>

   Using the related F-Statistics and  conparing these to calculated values, at the 95% confidence point,
 
  the null hypothesis was rejected for all three hypotheses, to conclude that countries with higher Latitude absolute-values, lower Average Temperatures and 
  higher Coastalities are indeed happier than those with opposite features 

 <h4><u> FORECASTING</u></h4>
 <ul><li> Between 2013 and 2016, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland led the Happiness League charts, but this changed in 2017 when Finland took the lead spot; and it hasn't looked back since then. 
  </li><br>
    <li> Furthermore, Forecasts show that for the next few years, from 2022 to 2026, Scandinavia will continue to take the four lead spots.  After then their will be a few replacements. However, Northern European countries will 
  remain the lead being followed by Southern and Eastern Europe. 
 </li><br>
  <li> Other countries to make significant leaps within this time include the United Kingdom, Malta, Kosovo, Bahrain
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> This information is useful for tourists, holiday-makers, researchers or students and investors seeking where to invest their time or wealth in the future.  </li></ul> 
   
   <h4><u> GOODNESS OF FIT TEST</u></h4>

  The Chi-Squared tool was used to test for the reliability of the regression model, at 90% level of confidence, and it was found to be a good fit.
  Thus we're sure to see some of the predicted data in the real life datasets in the near future. 
  
  
  <!--
  <h4><u> FLAGS</u></h4>
  Scandinavian countries so far, have taken the lead happiness spots. These all share similar pasts, culture and faiths, with similar flag symbolisms to reflect this.
  flags. Scandinavian flags bear the cross symbol
  could their be a link between this and their optimismistic energies.
  
  
  
  
  <br><br>
  Is it then a coincidence that the Happiness moguls share the same symbol? The cross?
  
  This research will attempt to define in its own way, the true meaning of this symbol.
  <br><br>
  The verb 'cross' means to go from one side to another, usually at ones risk, upon or in a created structure, such as a road, bridge, or boat/canoe etc.
  And the noun 'cross' is a four pointed structure, symbol or carving which could make 'crossing' possible, in two distinct ways, on a perpendicular axis.
  <br><br>
  
  Thus a cross is a symbol of sacrifice or preparedness to take one from where one is to where one desires or ought to be.
  
  Should there be any doubts left as to why these Northern European or Scandinavian countries should 
  lead if they are prepared to learn or do what it takes - Good governance etc - to get to a place called 'Happiness'

  <h4><u> COLOURS</u></h4>
  Flags are not uni-branded, they come in different shapes and colours. Colours are chosen based on different dactors, but keen observation identifies those with lasting joy-power. 
  These tend to be radiant in nature and to stand for brighter meaning/purpose.
  Such colours include, Red, white, blue, and gold. Is it then a coincidence that these are the very same colours that adorn most of the Northern European flags?

  <h4><u> SUMMARY </u></h4>
  For a nation to be truly happy, it must put effective social, financial, governmental and moral systems in place, in addition to ensure proper irrigation, ventilation and transportation.
  For among leading countries, the happiest tend to be those at high latitudes, far from the equator's steaming heat, and or surrounded by sufficient natural water sources that ensure cool air, plant growth and transportation routes. 

  Furthermore, surrounding oneself with radiant colours such as red, white and blue and meaningful insignia that renew your faith and confidence; will ensure continuous happiness!!
