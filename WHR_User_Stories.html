<h2> USER STORIES AND STATISTICS

<h2>  <u>USER STORIES</u></h2>
<Div id="rb3">

User stories are basically tools used by agile software developers to get directions about the product they are creating from the customers. They are an opportunity for users to fully describe in detail their exact product specifications based on its functionality and benefit.
 This, together with the list or sequence of next steps to be taken by the product owner and his team, make up the story features. They are best represented in tables. <br><br>


Data Analytics presents a slightly different view and variation. In a social research such as this one, the purpose or objective is basically a review of the topic at hand, wherein the customer, being in this case a concerned and curious citizen, requires an offering, and not a physical product.
 It features the research questions, and the answers and optimization strategies obtained and proferred by the analyst as a result of the research. Finally it presents the results as charts and dashboards for attractive visualization.
